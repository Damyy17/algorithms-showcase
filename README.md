# Algorithm-Showcase

Algorithm-Showcase is a web-based application designed to visually demonstrate how algorithms work step-by-step. It allows users to interactively explore popular algorithms by visualizing their execution and behavior. Whether you're learning how sorting, searching, or graph algorithms function, this platform provides an intuitive and engaging way to understand their underlying mechanics.

## Key Features:

- Step-by-Step Visualization: Watch algorithms in action and see how they evolve with each iteration.
- Interactive Exploration: Pause, resume, and step through different parts of the algorithm to understand each phase.
- Popular Algorithms: Currently supports a variety of algorithms, including sorting algorithms (like QuickSort, MergeSort), searching algorithms (like Binary Search), and more.
- Customizable Inputs: Customize input data and observe how the algorithm adapts to different scenarios.
